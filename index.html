<h2>People I’d Like to Meet</h2>
<p>
  Here are some people I’d love to meet as they are all considered some of the 
  brightest of their generations. I would love to just sit down over coffee or tea 
  and pick their brains about different topics just to see how they would respond 
  and what I could learn from them.
